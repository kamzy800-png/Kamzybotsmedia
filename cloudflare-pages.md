# Cloudflare Pages Deployment (SSR via Functions)

This project is a **TanStack Start** app. It already builds a Cloudflare-compatible
Worker bundle through `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` + nitro (configured by
`@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config`). You can deploy it to Cloudflare Pages with
Functions — **server functions, webhooks, and Paystack/NOWPayments verification
keep working**. This is NOT a static SPA deployment.

> If you want a pure static SPA on Cloudflare Pages, you would need to migrate
> off TanStack Start to plain Vite + React Router. That migration is intentionally
> not done here.

## 1. Build settings (Cloudflare dashboard)

When you create the Pages project, set:

| Field                | Value                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Framework preset     | **None**                                 |
| Build command        | `npm run build`                          |
| Build output dir     | `dist`                                   |
| Root directory       | (leave blank)                            |
| Node.js version      | `20`                                     |

The TanStack build produces a Cloudflare-compatible Worker into `dist/` plus
static assets. The `_worker.js` is loaded automatically by Cloudflare Pages.

> **Do NOT** add `public/_redirects` with `/* /index.html 200`. That rule
> would short-circuit the SSR Worker and break every server function, the
> auth flow, payment verification, and credential delivery. The TanStack
> Worker handles routing itself.

## 2. Required environment variables

In **Pages project → Settings → Environment variables**, add to both
**Production** and **Preview**:

### Client-visible (Vite — bundled into the browser build)
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jerhefcpsmcvxkmvyyqe.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your supabase publishable key>
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=jerhefcpsmcvxkmvyyqe
VITE_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_xxx        # or pk_test_xxx
VITE_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com        # used for payment redirects
```

### Server-only (must NEVER be exposed to the browser)
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://jerhefcpsmcvxkmvyyqe.supabase.co
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<same publishable key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your service role key>   # SECRET
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx                     # SECRET
NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY=<your nowpayments api key>      # SECRET
```

Mark the secret keys as **Encrypted** in the Cloudflare UI.

## 3. Paystack & NOWPayments webhook / redirect URLs

After your first deploy you get a URL like
`https://<project>.pages.dev` (or your custom domain).

- **Paystack callback URL**: not strictly needed — verification is done via
  `verifyPaystackPayment` server function after `PaystackPop.onSuccess`.
- **NOWPayments success URL**: `https://<your-domain>/wallet?funded=crypto`
- **NOWPayments cancel URL**:  `https://<your-domain>/wallet`
  (Both are sent automatically by the server function from `VITE_SITE_URL`.)

If you later add webhook-driven crediting, expose it under
`/api/public/<name>` (the `/api/public/*` prefix bypasses auth for external
callers — always verify signatures inside the handler).

---

## 4. Connecting via Git

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Cloudflare Pages → **Create project → Connect to Git** → pick the repo.
3. Apply the build settings from §1 and the env vars from §2.
4. Every push to `main` deploys to Production. Other branches deploy to Preview.

---

## 5. Connecting via Wrangler (alternative)

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=kamzybots-media
```

Set the same env vars with `wrangler pages secret put NAME --project-name=kamzybots-media`.

---

## 6. Custom domain

Pages → your project → **Custom domains → Set up a custom domain**. Cloudflare
will issue the certificate automatically. Update `VITE_SITE_URL` to match and
redeploy so payment redirect URLs use the new domain.

---

## 7. Smoke-test checklist after deploy

- [ ] Home page loads and SSR HTML returns a `200`
- [ ] `/auth` register + login works
- [ ] `/dashboard` shows wallet balance, orders, profile
- [ ] `/wallet` → Paystack flow credits wallet end-to-end
- [ ] `/wallet` → NOWPayments invoice + "Check Status" credits wallet
- [ ] `/admin` accessible by the admin email; product image upload works
- [ ] A purchase auto-delivers a credential from the product log pool
- [ ] Footer shows only Facebook + TikTok links
- [ ] Mobile (360px) layout still works on every page

If any page returns 500, check the **Cloudflare → Pages → Functions → Logs**
for the captured error stack.
