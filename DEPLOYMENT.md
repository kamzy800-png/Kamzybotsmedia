# KAMZYBOT'S MEDIA — Deployment & Setup

This app is a **TanStack Start** project (React 19 + Vite 7) backed by **Lovable Cloud (Supabase)**. The recommended hosting is **Lovable's built-in publish flow** (one-click, no config). The project is also configured to deploy on Vercel/Cloudflare with a small amount of setup.

## 1. Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | client + server | Lovable Cloud URL (auto-provided) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | client + server | Anon/publishable key (auto-provided) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | server only | Same as above for server functions |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | server only | Same |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | server only | Admin key — used by webhook handlers & credential delivery |
| `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` | server only | Paystack webhook verification |
| `VITE_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` | client | Paystack popup init |
| `NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY` | server only | NOWPayments manual verification |
| `LOVABLE_API_KEY` | server only | Lovable AI Gateway (already configured) |

> Inside Lovable, these are managed under **Cloud → Secrets**. Do **not** commit them to git.

## 2. Database

The Supabase database is provisioned automatically by Lovable Cloud. Tables created by migrations in `supabase/migrations/`:

- `profiles`, `user_roles`, `wallets`, `wallet_transactions`
- `products`, `product_categories`, `product_credentials` *(login logs delivered to buyers)*
- `orders`, `order_items`, `payment_intents`
- `site_settings`, `activity_logs`

RLS is enabled on every table. The first signup using `kamzybotsmedia@gmail.com` is auto-promoted to admin via the `handle_new_user` trigger.

### Product Logs (credentials)

- Admin → `/admin` → **Products** tab → key icon to bulk-import logs (one per line, e.g. `email:password`).
- On purchase, `purchase_with_wallet` deducts wallet balance & creates an order; then a TanStack server function calls `assign_credential_to_order`, which atomically locks one unassigned credential to that order. The same log can never be assigned twice (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`).
- Users view their delivered logs in **Dashboard → My Orders → Credentials**.

## 3. Deploying

### 3a. Lovable (recommended)

Just click **Publish** in the Lovable editor. Live at `https://kamzybots-media.lovable.app` (custom domains available in Project Settings).

### 3b. Vercel

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Import the repo in Vercel.
3. **Framework preset:** Other.
4. **Build command:** `npm run build`
5. **Output directory:** `.output/public` (TanStack Start / Nitro output).
6. Add all env vars from section 1 in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables.
7. After deploy, set the Supabase **Site URL** & **Redirect URLs** (Cloud → Auth) to your Vercel domain so Google OAuth callbacks work.

> `vercel.json` in the repo is for static-export overrides only; the Nitro Vercel preset handles routing automatically.

### 3c. Cloudflare Pages / Workers

The default Nitro target in `vite.config.ts` is `cloudflare`. `npm run build` produces a Worker bundle in `.output/`. Deploy with `wrangler deploy` or the Cloudflare Pages GitHub integration.

### 3d. Netlify

Set build command `npm run build`, publish directory `.output/public`, then add env vars from section 1. Nitro's Netlify preset handles function routing.

## 4. Payments

- **Paystack:** initialize in the Wallet page; webhook URL `/api/public/paystack-webhook` verifies signature with `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` and credits the wallet via `credit_wallet`.
- **NOWPayments (manual):** user submits payment proof from the Wallet page; admin verifies & credits manually from the Admin → Users tab.

---

## 5. OAuth

Google OAuth is wired via the Lovable broker (`src/integrations/lovable`). After deploying to a custom domain, add the new origin to:
- Lovable Cloud → Auth → Site URL + Redirect URLs
- Google Cloud Console → OAuth client → Authorized redirect URIs
